## Data

This project relies on external datasets that are **not included** in the repository.

Required data:
- GTFS feeds for Milan public transport (ATM)
- OpenStreetMap extracts used to build the street network

These datasets are large, so they must be downloaded and placed locally.

The scripts expect a local `data/` directory with paths configured accordingly.
