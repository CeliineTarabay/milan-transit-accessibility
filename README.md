# milan-transit-accessibility
This repository contains a small experiment in transit accessibility for Milan. Starting from a fixed origin, it computes travel times on a regular grid using GTFS and OSM data, then repeats the analysis while limiting the number of allowed transfers. The result is a set of maps showing how the network behaves once transfers are constrained.
